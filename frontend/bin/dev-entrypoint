trap unlock_setup HUP INT QUIT KILL TERM EXIT

# 3: Specify a default command, in case it wasn't issued:
if [ -z "$1" ]; then set -- ember server --live-reload-port 35730 "$@"; fi

# 4: Run the setup routine if the command is 'ember':
if [[ "$1" = "ember" ]]
then
  # 5: Wait until the setup 'lock' file no longer exists:
  while [ -f $APP_SETUP_LOCK ]; do wait_setup; done

  # 6: 'Lock' the setup process, to prevent a race condition with
  # another container trying to install dependencies:
  lock_setup

  # 7: Check or install npm/bower dependencies:
  check-dependencies || yarn install

  # 8: 'Unlock' the setup process:
  unlock_setup
fi

# 9: Execute the given or default command:
exec "$@"
